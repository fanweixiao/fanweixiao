<h2> Hey there! I'm C.C</h2>

🧛🏻‍ Working on low latency streaming serverless and geo-distributed system.

### 🌎 What I care about: The Demand For Real-Time Digital User Experiences

It’s no secret that today’s users want instant gratification, every productivity application is more powerful when it's collaborative. but, currently, when we talk about `distribution`, it's represents **distribution in data center**, API is far away from their users from all over the world.

If an application can be deployed anywhere close to their end users, solve the problem, this is **Geo-distributed System Architecture**:

So, I started [YoMo](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo) project, build a framework, reduce the complexity when developer building geo-distributed system.
